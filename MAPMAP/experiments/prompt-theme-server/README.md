# Prompt-theme server experiments

This folder now supplies the branch's generation API through `npm run theme:dev` (port 8773). The active page is `src/editor/createPromptThemePanel.ts`; see [integration and startup](../../docs/prompt-theme-integration.md). The **첫 결과 복원 · 크리스마스** button remains a separate GPU-free reviewed-asset demo.

## Included logic

- `decoration_profiles.json`, `profile_decorations.py`: active `object-profiles-v1` path. Four explicit object profiles own the generation layout, protected regions and decoration extraction. FLUX produces RGB; code constructs RGBA. No Qwen-Image-Layered dependency.
- `client/`: historical shared-state client snapshots, not the active UI. The active page uses `/approve` and browser-local placements instead of remote shared state.
- `building_quality_experiment.py`: archived single-building quality studies; no automatic application. See `docs/building-quality-experiment.md` for the unsuccessful results and limitations.

- `theme_pipeline.py`: rule-based prompt parsing, TMX composition, RGB gain/bias, per-object FLUX calls, preview and explicit application with backups.
- `object_decorations.py`: object-specific source surfaces and decoration extraction; buildings use roof/eaves, trees foliage, fountains a game-specific rim profile; stalls use strips.
- `refine_object_surfaces.py`: reprocess saved references into a new trial without deleting prior results.
- `restore_approved_decorations.py`: create a new record reusing the original reviewed FLUX PNGs and their exact placement coordinates. This is restoration, not fresh generation.
- `test_*.py`: 32 source-preservation, profile, extraction and browser-approval tests.

The automated generation trials were judged worse than the original hand-tuned decorations. Restoring the reviewed assets fixes the current demo, not arbitrary future generation quality. The generated reference, RGB masks and resizing can still lose shading, wires or fine details.

## Server-only dependencies

Set `THEME_PROJECT` to the repository's absolute path before importing these modules (their snapshot location differs from the live `style-service` location). Install FastAPI, uvicorn, Pillow, NumPy and requests in a dedicated Python environment. The tests use the repository's town TMX and do not call the GPU.

```powershell
$env:THEME_PROJECT = (Get-Location).Path
python -m unittest discover -s experiments/prompt-theme-server -p 'test_*.py'
```

The image generation service is external; running these tests does not download models or call FLUX. To start the experimental API from the repository root after setting `THEME_PROJECT`:

```sh
npm run theme:dev
```

The active Vite proxies point to port 8773. The branch renderer consumes color/night/twinkle settings. Browser approval replaces only selected generated objects and global settings, retaining unrelated placements. The historical `/apply` route still requires explicit `THEME_STATE_URL` and replaces all remote decorations; the active page never calls it.

Type-check the archived client separately:

```sh
npx tsc --noEmit --strict --skipLibCheck --target ES2022 --module ESNext --moduleResolution Bundler --lib ES2022,DOM,DOM.Iterable experiments/prompt-theme-server/client/createPromptThemePanel.ts
```

Real generation requires a running FLUX `/style-transfer` service (`THEME_FLUX_URL`). Browser-local operation does not require `THEME_STATE_URL`. Artifact URLs must return image bytes, not a SPA fallback. The local API reads and writes JSON as UTF-8 on both Windows and Linux.

## Current restored result

Live restoration ID: `321f30155d134d03ba3914c1e962d9da`. Its manifest and preview are archived under `public/experiments/restored-first-quality`. Manifest `/theme-runs/…` URLs are historical live-server provenance, not branch asset URLs. The working demo uses `public/experiments/flux-decorations-20260909/placements.json` instead. No credentials, service logs or user-state backups are included.
